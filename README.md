# GDD_VkEngine

This is a work in progress of creating a Vulkan-based game engine with extensive help from the Vulkan Tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).  His tutorial places everything in a single file, this is my attempt at creating an OOP-based structure from his work.

Please note, this is not a fully functioning engine yet.
